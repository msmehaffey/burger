# burger
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.


* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* In addition, there is a clear button that will clear both of the lists from the page.

# This applicaiton is great for keeping track of all the great resaturant items you want to try, weather or not they are burgers. When you come across something you want to add to the list, simply submit it to the list of items that are waiting to be devoured. Once you've enjoyed the tasty burger (or other item) simply click the devoured button to mark it off your list as devoured. Enjoy!!
